Build a self-hosted, open-source web app similar in flow and aesthetics to StartupDeck, focused on AI-powered business idea validation, analysis, and pitch creation — but tailored to your own niche, brand, and functionality.

This tool should match or exceed the UX and intelligence of StartupDeck, but run completely without proprietary APIs like OpenAI or Gemini — using open-source LLMs like Mistral, LLaMA, or Phi-2.
